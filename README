This project has been abandoned. I've started rewriting the nascent game
engine in a new project available at
<http://github.com/foxostro/GutsyStormCocoa>. The main reason for doing
this was that I was simply not able to get acceptable performance out of
Python even with extensive work on performance optimization and research
into Python optimization. Basically, it seemed my options were to either
1) rewrite very large portions of the engine in another language (really,
almost everything would have to be rewritten) or 2) 2) start over in another
language. I chose to do a rewrite.

Gutsy Storm is the codename for an otherwise nameless game project which
seeks to investigate 3D game programming with Python and Pyglet. The game
is so far intended to use a voxel-based, procedurally generated terrain
similar to Minecraft. This, however, is not exactly a Minecraft clone.
Instead, the plan is to use Minecraft-like terrain and terrain editing
functionality as the basis for the game world and the world editor. The
game itself will be a simple hack-n-slash RPG which itself would be
considered to be somewhat of a Diablo clone.

Dependencies:
  * Numpy
  * PIL
  * Pyglet

To Run: You must build a few frameworks before you can use some of the
prototype scripts. For example, Perlin Noise generation requires the
framework pnoise.framework to be built and installed to "./Frameworks/".

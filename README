Gutsy Storm is the codename for an otherwise nameless game project which
seeks to investigate 3D game programming with Python and Pyglet. The game
is so far intended to use a voxel-based, procedurally generated terrain
similar to Minecraft. This, however, is not exactly a Minecraft clone.
Instead, the plan is to use Minecraft-like terrain and terrain editing
functionality as the basis for the game world and the world editor. The
game itself will be a simple hack-n-slash RPG which itself would be
considered to be somewhat of a Diablo clone.

Dependencies:
  * Numpy
  * PIL
  * Pyglet

To Run: You must build a few frameworks before you can use some of the
prototype scripts. For example, Perlin Noise generation requires the
framework pnoise.framework to be built and installed to "./Frameworks/".

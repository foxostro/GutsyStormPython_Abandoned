Gutsy Storm is the codename for an otherwise nameless game project which
seeks to investigate 3D game programming with Python and Pyglet. The game
is so far intended to use a voxel-based, procedurally generated terrain
similar to Minecraft. This, however, is not exactly a Minecraft clone.
Instead, the plan is to use Minecraft-like terrain and terrain editing
functionality as the basis for the game world and the world editor. The
game itself will be a simple hack-n-slash RPG which itself could be
considered to be somewhat of a Diablo clone.
